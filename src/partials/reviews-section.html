        I love this chocolate bar. Perfect combination of light crispy wafer,
        covered in a thin layer chocolate.

        This chocolate confection is a delight! A delight! The wafer is light
        and crisp, the hazelnut cream is smooth, and the chocolate is good.

        Chocolate is a family favourite treat. Love the delicious smooth
        chocolate and the creaminess inside. The wafer is soft but crunchy.

        The chocolate assortment was delicious. Both dark and milk chocolate
        pieces were smooth and just right on the sweetness level.

        This is delicious. It so rich and flavorful you donâ€™t need to use as
        many. I love topping an apple with almond butter and these chips for a
        snack.

        This is simply the best chocolate around, and I'm just thrilled to
        support a local company! Best local chocolate - world class :)
