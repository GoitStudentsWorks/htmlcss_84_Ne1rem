                    Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing
                    cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of
                    chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a
                    beverage in pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all
                    milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe,
                    increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin
                    America.

                    Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands
                    of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young
                    mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are
                    able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is
                    called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the
                    immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases.
                    Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.

                    Almonds, pistachios, and walnuts are some types of nuts that
                    contain healthy nutrients. When eaten as part of a
                    nutrient-dense diet, these 9 nuts may offer benefits such as
                    reducing your risk of heart disease. They're a good source
                    of fiber, healthy fats, and plant protein. Plus, they're
                    great on their own, paired with fruit, or added to dishes
                    like salads, desserts, and grains.

                  <p>
                    Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%.
                    One of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type
                    of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of
                    chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a
                    taste comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas
                    milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable
                    flavor of chocolate is very versatile.
